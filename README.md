# Bikesharing
## Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was to analysis CitiBike sharing data for New York City. We looked at how gender, time of day, and age influence how the ride share service usage ebbs and flows. 

Tableau dashboards can be explored in the following links.

## Results:
The following charts show how clear patterns arise with how and what type of users are using this service.     

This map shows a clear pattern that in the center of the city as you get closer to lower Manhattan the more overall rentals there are.

We can look at bike rentals by gender. As shown in this graphic a higher percentage are males.

Next we look at how long bikes are being checked out. When is illustrated in this graphic. A clear spike can be seen.

We can then look at the combination of the previous two graphics to not only look at trip duration but see how this fits within the framework of which gender is renting the bikes.

The following three graphics look at the relationship between days of the week, times of the day and gender to illustrate when the peak hours are for rentals and who is using them.

## Summary:
This analysis clearly shows patterns of when bikes are being rented and by who. There seems to be room in the market in general to advertise more to women. I think an additional look at this analysis could look at the starting and stopping locations of bikes.This could help inform the need for more or less bikes to be present in given locations.
